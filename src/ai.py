        In this document, the background behind the protocol design and economic model is explained.\n
        LP Finance is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol on Solana. LP Finance designed Protocol Debt Vault (PDV) and liquidity provider incentives advancing stability fees to dramatically enhance scalability of synthetic assets.
        At a high level, the protocol allows users to leverage zSOL to create strategies such as leveraged liquid staking and short selling. Liquidity providers can earn interest rates and swap fees at the same time.
        On LP Finance, users can do the following: Leverage SOL staking yields, Short-sell, Earn interest by providing liquidity

        - Borrow Limit: Maximum value (USD) of zSOL that can be borrowed.
        - Liquidation Threshold: A threshold of collateral value where the account would be liquidated. If collateral value drops below "Liquidation Threshold" liquidation might occur.
        - LTV: Loan to Value ratio, which is calculated as follows.
        `LTV = borrowedValueUsd / collateralValueUsd * 100`

        """
        zSOL is a over collateralized synthetic asset, which can be minted after depositing collateral. Even if the UX is identical to lending protocols, borrowing/repaying is performed as minting/burning zSOL.
        The collateral accepted on LP Finance are as follows.
        - SOL
        - mSOL
        - USDC
        It is only possible to deposit one collateral per account. To deposit other collateral, account should fully withdraw collateral.
        Once an account borrows zSOL, stability fee would be applied which is equivalent to borrow interest on lending protocols. Stability fee is applied daily and compounding which is calculated as follows.
        `daily_stability_fee = stability_fee_apr / 365`
        Stability fee is dynamic which is decided by LP Finance DAO through governance. Unlike lending protocols, there are no "zSOL suppliers". Therefore stability fee is paid to zSOL-SOL liquidity providers to allow liquidity to linearly scale in respect of zSOL supply.
        ## Mint Halt: zSOL mint is halted if zSOL's market price is 5% below SOL price.
        """,
        """
        zSOL-SOL liquidty providers can deposit Saber zSOL-SOL LP tokens to earn stability fee for zSOL borrowers. This allows zSOL market liquidity to scale linearly in respect to zSOL supply, increasing the capacity of zSOL to be used for leveraging purposes.
        Same as zSOL stability fee epoch, the zSOL rewards are distributed every 24h and can claim by interacting with the program.
        """,
        """
        Peg-stability module (PSM) is a common function in most stablecoin issuance protocols. PSM allows 1:1 swap between a stablecoin issued by a protocol and quote token (ex. USDC).
        For zSOL PSM should allow zSOL <-> SOL at 1:1 ratio, however LP Finance uses mSOL, which is a liquid staking derivative of SOL.
        ## Pricing of mSOL & zSOL: mSOL and zSOL's market price is not correctly accounted to SOL price. Therefore the program treats the price as follows.
        - mSOL: True price (value when delayed unstake)
        - zSOL: SOL price
        This prevents oracle exploits where zSOL or mSOL price depegs, causing higher redemption of mSOL or higher issuance of zSOL, causing zSOL to be undercollateralized.
        ## Risk of using mSOL
        mSOL is not always pegged to staked SOL's value. As mSOL to be fully claimed for SOL, a full epoch has to pass, which means in a volatile market condition, people would rather sell mSOL on market rather than wait to claim.
        Here is an example of mSOL depegging during FTX collapse event. (mSOL-SOL Saber)
        In case of mSOL depeg event, zSOL would be depegged at an equivalent rate. This is not a bug but a "design". Short-sellers can take benefit by shorting zSOL instead of SOL as zSOL is likely to fall more in price where SOL price crashes.
        ## Mechanism: Unlike other PSM, LP Finance implement "Protocol Debt Vault" which is an account managed by LP Finance DAO. It acts same as other accounts, but have solely mSOL as collateral, maximum LTV of 100%, and cannot be liquidated.
        PSM interacts with the Protocol Debt Vault in the backend as follows.
        - Swap mSOL-->zSOL: Deposit mSOL as collateral & borrow zSOL
        - Swap zSOL-->mSOL: Repay zSOL & withdraw mSOL collateral
        There is a swap fee for claiming mSOL (zSOL-->mSOL), which is a revenue source for LP Finance DAO. Additionally, when PSM activities are static, Protocol Debt Vault earns staking yields which is more efficient than having SOL.
        """,
        """
        On LP Finance, there are two types of liquidation.
        - T1: Accounts with SOL or mSOL as collateral
        - T2: Accounts with USDC as collateral
        ## T1 Liquidation: T1 liquidation is likely to happen when stability fee exceeds the value accural of SOL or mSOL. When using SOL as collateral, account is in higher risk of liquidation when not managed continuously. However, mSOL has a low risk of liquidation due to staking yields.
        Additionally, as mSOL price is calculated using "True price" liquidation does not occur even if mSOL depegs.
        Following are steps of T1 liquidation.
        1. Liquidator triggers liquidation of target account
        2. IF SOL, mint mSOL via calling Marinade Finance CPI
        3. Target account's mSOL collateral transferred to Protocol Debt Vault
        4. Target account's zSOL debt transferred to Protocol Debt Vault
        5. Target account initialized
        There is near-to-zero risk of bad debt for T1 liquidation. In case liquidation occurs, Protocol Debt Vault earns liquidation fees which is normally (100 - liquidation_threshold)%.
        ## T2 Liquidation: T2 liquidation occurs when SOL price rises, which triggers LTV to increase. Following are steps of T2 liquidation.
        1. Liquidator triggers liquidation of target account
        2. Liquidator transfers mSOL to Protocol Debt Vault
        3. Liquidator redeems USDC from target account
        4. Target account's zSOL debt transferred to Protocol Debt Vault
        The amount of USDC to be claimed with mSOL is calculated as follows.
        ```
        repaid_zsol_amt = msol_transfer_amt * (msol_price / sol_price)
        repaid_ratio = repaid_zsol_amt / borrowed_zsol_amt
        usdc_claim_amt = usdc_collateral_amt * repaid_ratio
        ```
        Let's assume liquidating the following account
        - Collateral: 1000 USDC (1000 USD)
        - Debt: 32.5 zSOL (650 USD)
        If liquidator transfers 16.25 zSOL (325 USD, assume 1 mSOL= 1 SOL),
        ```
        usdc_claim_amt = 1000 * (16.25 * (20/20)) / 32.5
        >> usdc_claim_amt = 500
        In this case, liquidator was able to earn 175 USDC. The script is currently closed source, but users can interact with the UI to perform liquidation on https://app.lp.finance/liquidate.
