# zSOL-SOL Liquidity Providers

zSOL-SOL liquidty providers can deposit [Saber zSOL-SOL LP tokens](https://solscan.io/token/zSo2NgZQ5fv2bQ393CfCo6szdbeAc5RciwFkwBS659W) to earn stability fee for zSOL borrowers. This allows zSOL market liquidity to scale linearly in respect to zSOL supply, increasing the capacity of zSOL to be used for leveraging purposes.

Same as zSOL stability fee epoch, the zSOL rewards are distributed every 24h and can claim by interacting with the program.
